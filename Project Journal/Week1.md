XP Value: Feedback

We did add a new column in the Project taskboard in Github to make sure that everything we did individually went through a review by other team members.

We did check with other Unity experts about the learning difficulty, capability etc.

We did meet multiple times in the week physically and over the phone to make sure we had an idea of what everyone is doing and shared our opinions.
